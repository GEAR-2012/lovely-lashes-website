"My name is Elvira. I am from Hungary but my family and I moved Scotland over 10 years ago.",
"I first began my lash journey in 2015 when I qualified with my first certificate. Since then I have welcomed ladies looking to enhance their beauty. Initially eyelash extensions were a hobby but as my skills grew so did my clients and it soon became a full time job.",
"In March 2017, with the support of my family, we opened Lovely Lashes  Beauty House on George street. Being in the City Centre allows me to be accessible to all my clients as I am easy to find and there’s plenty of parking close by.",
"Soon after opening the salon I attended the Hungarian Lash Academy to further my skills. In July 2017 I achieved a Master Volume Certificate and achieved a Lash Diploma.",
"I am extremely passionate about providing my clients with the best service and always look to improve my skills and products to stay competitive.",
"To me, lash extensions emphasise the beauty of a glance. I love to see my clients admiring themselves in the mirror with their new extensions giving them confidence and feeling beautiful. It’s the best part of my job!",
"My ongoing promise to all my clients is to always provide them with a safe and clean environment in my salon, the best of products sourced responsibly, and that I will continue to keep my passion for lash extensions alive with continued training and experience.",
"I want to thank all the lovely ladies who have supported me along my lash journey, your continued support and friendship is what keeps me going."
